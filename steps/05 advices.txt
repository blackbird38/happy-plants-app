Problem:
make:user User + make:auth + make:registration-form + register a user with only email and password (defaults for make:user) => should not be not null conflict when updating User with make:entity and setting not null columns (!)
fixed: delete database (recordings) and redo migrations


Problem: An exception has been thrown during the rendering of a template ("Could not find the entrypoints file from Webpack: the file "...\happy-plants-app/public/build/entrypoints.json" does not exist.").
=> npm run dev
