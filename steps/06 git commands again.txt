before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date:
git pull
git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
switch branch:
git checkout [name_of_your_new_branch]

to see all branches
git branch -a 

git checkout master
git merge [name_of_your_new_branch]
